## Introduction

In the world of data analysis and visualization, it is critical to convey information in a compelling and insightful manner. Highcharts, a popular JavaScript library, is a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive charts. What if you could use Highcharts' power directly in your Python projects with a simple 'pip install' command? 'highcharts-core' is a Python package that seamlessly integrates Highcharts functionality into your Python environment.

## What is `highcharts-core`?
'highcharts-core' is a Python package that connects your Python environment to the Highcharts JavaScript library. By installing this package, you can use Highcharts to its full potential directly within your Python scripts, making data visualization a breeze.

## Installation

Getting started with `highcharts-core` is as easy as running a single command:

```bash
pip install highcharts-core
```
This command fetches and installs the necessary Python bindings for Highcharts, enabling you to integrate Highcharts charts effortlessly into your Python applications.

## Basic Usage:

Once installed, using `highcharts-core` is straightforward. Here's a quick example of creating a simple line chart:

```python
import highcharts
chart = highcharts.Highchart()
options = {
    'title': {
        'text': 'My First Highcharts Chart'
    },
    'xAxis': {
        'categories': ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
    },
    'yAxis': {
        'title': {
            'text': 'Value'
        }
    },
    'series': [{
        'name': 'Data Series',
        'data': [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]
    }]
}
chart.set_dict_options(options)
chart.save_file('my_chart.html')
```

In this example, we create a basic line chart with specified x-axis categories, y-axis title, and a data series. The resulting chart is saved as an HTML file (`my_chart.html`), which can be opened in any web browser.


## Advanced Features:

`highcharts-core` supports a wide range of Highcharts features, allowing you to create sophisticated and interactive visualizations. You can customize chart types, add annotations, implement drilldowns, and much moreâ€”all from the comfort of your Python environment.

```python
# Advanced example with multiple series and customizations
advanced_chart = highcharts.Highchart()

advanced_options = {
    'title': {
        'text': 'Advanced Highcharts Chart'
    },
    'xAxis': {
        'categories': ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
    },
    'yAxis': {
        'title': {
            'text': 'Values'
        }
    },
    'series': [{
        'name': 'Series 1',
        'data': [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]
    }, {
        'name': 'Series 2',
        'data': [5, 15, 10, 20, 25]
    }],
    'plotOptions': {
        'column': {
            'stacking': 'normal'
        }
    }
}
advanced_chart.set_dict_options(advanced_options)
advanced_chart.save_file('advanced_chart.html')
```
